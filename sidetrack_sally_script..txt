Narrator (Ember):
In the bustling town of Everwhim, one wizard-in-training raced through the cobblestone streets with great purpose… or at least, that was the plan.

Sidetrack Sally (Maple):
Right! Task for today—pick up a vial of Moonblossom Nectar! Easy peasy!

Ten minutes later, Sally emerged with three cinnamon buns and a tiny fire sprite that had hitched a ride in her pocket.

Sidetrack Sally (Maple):
Alright! No more distractions. Focus, Sally! Focus—ooooooh! A street magician!

sfx: [ "crowd_applause_small.mp3", "juggling_orbs_whoosh.mp3", "sparkle_pop.mp3" ]

Narrator (Ember):
A street magician juggled glowing orbs while the crowd cheered.

Sidetrack Sally (Maple):
Wait—I can do that! Watch this!

sfx: [ "magic_surge_whoosh.mp3", "crowd_gasp.mp3" ]

Narrator (Ember):
And then… she turned the magician’s hat into a bowl of pudding.

Oops.

By the time Sally reached Magda’s Potion Shop, the sun was setting. Magda looked unimpressed.

Magda (Spruce):
Let me guess… you got distracted?

Sidetrack Sally (Maple):
What? Me? Pfft. No way! I just… took the scenic route?

sfx: [ "vial_slide_counter.mp3" ]

Magda handed her the vial of Moonblossom Nectar.

Sidetrack Sally (Maple):
Thank you! Master Orwyn will be so happy I—wait… why did I need this again?

Ooooh… shiny.

sfx: [ "sparkle_chime.mp3", "giggle_faint.mp3" ]

Narrator (Ember):
And off she went—once more, gloriously sidetracked.

The end… for now.
